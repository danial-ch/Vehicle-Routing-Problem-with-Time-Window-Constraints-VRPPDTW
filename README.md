# Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window Constraints(VRPPDTW)

## Description
This project is a Python-based solver for the Vehicle Routing Problem with time window constraints (VRPPDTW) using the DOcplex solver. It allows users to optimize routes for vehicles to efficiently deliver people within a network while respecting pickup and delivery time windows

## Usage
1. Run the main function within the VRPPDTW.py file. As the input, enter the folder name of one of the samples(For example 2). This will run the code and output 4 json files for chosen l_ik, t_ik, x_ijk and finally buses_paths which includes all the information necessary.

## Examples
To see examples of how the VRPWT solver can be used, check out the `Solution` within each of the samples.
